## Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning
Using Machine Learning code to analyzes texts to differentiate when positive and negative.

### Introduction
Sentiment analysis is a machine learning tool that analyzes texts for polarity, from positive to negative. Machine learning systems may be taught how to recognize sentiment without human input by using text-based examples of emotions to teach them.
Simply explained, machine learning is the process through which computers learn new jobs without being specifically programmed to carry them out. Sentiment analysis models may be taught to go beyond simple definitions and to comprehend things like context, sarcasm, and poorly used words.
